# Exploring Distributed Functional Representations with fMRI: A Modern Take on the Haxby et al. (2001) Study

This notebook revisits the seminal work of [Haxby et al. (2001)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1063736?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) using contemporary multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques. This study was pivotal in demonstrating that distributed patterns of brain activity can encode information about visual stimuli, laying the foundation for modern MVPA and representational similarity analysis (RSA) methods.

We will explore the following:
- **Data Visualization:** Understanding the structure and function of fMRI data.
- **Masking Techniques:** Applying and visualizing masks to focus on specific brain regions.
- **Modeling fMRI Data:** Using General Linear Models (GLMs) to connect brain activity with stimuli.
- **MVPA Analysis:** Decoding brain activity patterns associated with different visual categories.
- **Voxel Exclusion Analysis:** Investigating the impact of removing top explanatory voxels on decoding performance.

This analysis serves both as a tribute to the original work and as a demonstration of how modern methods can enhance our understanding of distributed representations in the brain.
