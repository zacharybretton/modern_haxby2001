# Exploring Distributed Functional Representations with fMRI: A Modern Take on Haxby et al. (2001)

This project revisits the groundbreaking study by [Haxby et al. (2001)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1063736?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed), which demonstrated that distributed patterns of brain activity encode information about visual stimuli. Using contemporary multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques, this notebook explores and expands upon Haxby's original findings.

## Key Areas of Exploration

- **Data Visualization:** Gain insights into the structure and function of fMRI data.
- **Masking Techniques:** Learn how to apply and visualize masks to focus on specific brain regions.
- **Modeling fMRI Data:** Understand the application of General Linear Models (GLMs) to connect brain activity with visual stimuli.
- **MVPA Analysis:** Decode patterns of brain activity associated with different visual categories using MVPA.
- **Voxel Exclusion Analysis:** Explore the impact of excluding top explanatory voxels on the accuracy of decoding performance.

This project not only honors the original work but also illustrates how modern methods can deepen our understanding of distributed representations in the brain.
